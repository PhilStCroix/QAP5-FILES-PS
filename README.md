QAP 5 ASSIGNMENT

Introduction to JavaScript Sandbox
This project is a JavaScript sandbox that demonstrates how to read and iterate through JSON data using the fetch API. The sandbox includes an HTML file, a JavaScript file, and a JSON file that contains sample data.

Getting Started
To get started, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in your web browser.

Usage
Once the page has loaded, open the browser console to see the results of the code execution. The code reads the data from the qap5.json file, iterates through the array, and displays information about each person in the console.
